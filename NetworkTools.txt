https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/120153/resolving-mac-address-from-ip-address-in-linux

Mac Address Finder : https://aruljohn.com/mac.pl

1. ifconfig 
	shows interfaces that are up and their ip address, mac address, broadcast and other details.

2. ifconfig enp0s8 192.168.56.10 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
	Add IP Address for adapter enp0s8 to 192.168.56.10 and mask 24 bit and up the adapter

3. ip a
   ip ad
   ip address
   ip address show
   Shows the ip address and other links which are either up or down with their L2/L3 details
   
4. ip address add 192.168.56.10/24 dev enp0s8
	Add a new ip address to your device enp0s8
	
5. ip address del 192.168.56.10/24 dev enp0s8
	Delete just the ip address of enp0s8 and not the interface itself.

5. ip link 
   ip link show
	Similar to ip a but shows the status of the devices
	
6. ip link set enp0s8 netns 1
	This will set the netns of the link to root namespace
   ip link set enp0s9 netns red
	This will set the netns of the link to red namespace
	
7. ip link set enp0s8 down
   ip link set enp0s8 up
   
	Bring down the adapter interface enp0s8 down and then up.
	To see the status of the down link run "ip link" see the <...,UP,...>

8. ip route
	CAUTION: Make sure there is no double entry otherwise no connectivity OR destination out of reach
	Gives you the ip address, gateway of the devices in your network

9. route 
	CAUTION: Make sure there is no double entry otherwise no connectivity OR destination out of reach
	Gives you the same information of ip route but tabular
	
10. ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 dev enp0s8
	Set the device enp0s8 use 192.168.1.1 as its default gateway

11. ip route add 10.0.0.0/24 via 0.0.0.0 dev veth0-d 
	Creates the entry at the following table in route
	Destination 	Gateway 	Genmask 		Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
	10.0.0.0 		0.0.0.0		255.255.255.0	UG     100    0   0  veth0-d
	
12. ip route del 10.0.0.0/32
	Deletes 1st entry from the following table in route
	Destination 	Gateway 	Genmask 		Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
	10.0.0.0 		0.0.0.0		255.255.255.255	UG     100    0   0  veth0-d
	10.0.0.0 		0.0.0.0		255.255.255.0	UG     100    0   0  veth0-d
	
13. route del -net 10.0.0.0 gw 0.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev veth0-d  
	Deletes 1st entry from the following table in route
	Destination 	Gateway 	Genmask 		Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
	10.0.0.0 		0.0.0.0		255.255.255.0 	UG     100    0   0  veth0-d
	10.0.0.0 		0.0.0.0		255.255.255.0 	UG     100    0   0  veth1-d
	
14. ip neigh
	 Same as ip address show
	
15. nslookup google.com
	Helps you to resolve the webaddress to ip address using the DNS service provided at IP address mentioned in /etc/resolv.conf
	
16. dig

17. vim /etc/resolv.conf
	Helps you open file with the address of different nameserver that provide us DNS service
	add -> nameserver 8.8.8.8 (google nameserver)
	add -> nameserver 8.8.4.4 (google nameserver)

18. ping 192.168.56.6 -c 1
	Send one ICMP packets to the device with ip address mention 
	
19. ping -I enp0s8 192.168.56.6
	Send ICMP packet from network device enp0s8 to ip address 56.6
	
20. fping -s -g 192.168.56.1 192.168.56.101
	Ping IP address from 56.1 to 56.101 
	alternate names: fping / fing

21. arp -a 

22. arping -I <interface> -c 1 <host> 
	arping -I eth0 -c1 192.168.1.2
	
23. tcpdump -D
	Give you the devices that can be listened to your devices
	
	tcpdump -i enp0s8
	Give you the packets arriving at the adapter device enp0s8
	
24. nmap -P0 -O 192.168.56.5
	 Free security scanner which gives the following result
	 1. OS running on the IP
	 2. MAC address of the device
	 3. open ports available running which services
	 4. Next hop
	 
25. netstat -tulpn | grep ':6653'
	 -l : tells nestat to only show listening sockets
	 -t tells to display tcp connection
	 -n instructs it show numerical address
	 -p show process ID and process names
	 -u udp connection
	Install netstat using the following
	sudo apt install net-tools 

26. ss --all 
	 Shows the state of All ports. Listening or not listening

	ss -l
	 Show the port that are Listening.
	 
	ss -ta 
	 Shows All the port that are using Tcp
	 
	ss -lu
	 Shows the port that are Listening and using Udp.
	 
	ss -p
	 Shows the Process id with the port number
	
	ss --inet -nap	
	 
	Mix as per wish example "ltp"
	
26. sudo fuser -k 6653/tcp
	 Kill the process which is using port 6653 and is TCP
	 
27. ethtool -S veth1
	 S: statistics
	 i: interface show details
	 
	 If you have a veth pair veth1 <-> eth1 then you can trace where the other veth pair is given you have one.
	 This command will give you peer_ifindex as some number. Use ip link to find that index in different netns or docker.
	 Eg:
	 ethtool -S veth1
		peer_ifindex: 4
	 
	 ip link
		 1. lo
		 2. enp0s3
		 3. veth1
		 4. eth1
		So from this we can understand eth1 is the peer of veth1
	
	Note: The ifindex of devices can be seen using the following:
		cat /sys/class/net/enp0s3/ifindex
		
29. iptable
	Used to create firewall. It can drop or add packets as per requirement. Didn't use it till now. 
	help: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iptables-command-in-linux-with-examples/
	
30. anydump.sh
	Tcpdump just shows the output without mentioning the interface in which the packet is received. 
	The code by Sebastian Haas append the interface name with the packet. 
	help1: https://sebastianhaas.de/anydump-release/ 
	Its a bash script copy it from his blog and paste it in any editor and run it like tcpdump.

I) How to create Network NamespaceLinux VETH Pair - Virtual Ethernet Pair

ip link 	# Shows existing network device configuration

ip link add tap1 type veth peer name tap2  #add 2 network devices connected in form of a pipe with tap1 
										at beginning and device type veth(virtual ethernet) and end tap2

ip netns add red 			# Create a network namespace(netns) red
ip netns add blue			# Create a network namespace(netns) blue

ip link set tap1 netns red	#shift tap1 to netns red
ip link set tap2 netns blue #shift tap2 to netns blue

ip netns exec red ip a 	#See the network devices within netns red and observe the device state is down
ip netns exec red ip link set tap1 up 	#We set the device state of tap1 to be UP

ip netns exec blue ip a	#See the network devices within netns blue and observe the device state of tap2 is down.
ip netns exec blue ip link set tap2 up	#We set the device state of tap2 to be UP

ip netns exec red ifconfig tap1 192.168.1.2/24 	#Set the ip address of tap1 in netns red to be 1.2/24
ip netns exec blue ifconfig tap2 192.168.1.3/24	#Set the ip address of tap2 in netns blue to be 1.3/24

ip netns exec red ping 192.168.1.3		#Try to ping to the netns blue using tap1 
ip netns exec blue ping 192.168.1.2		#Try to ping to the netns red using tap2

NB: This ping works for the following reason
1. the "ip route" entry for both of the will have an entry which will have dev that are end of pipes (tap1,tap2).
2. If there are multiple pipes connecting 2 netns then make sure there is just one entry for one netns to another.

				SHORTCUT
				# ip netns add net1
				# ip netns add net2
				# ip link add veth1 netns net1 type veth peer name veth2 netns net2

			(h1)--(s1)--(h2)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WgUwUf1d34&t=29s
ip link			#observe the link
ip a 			#observe the address of links
ip route		#observe the route for links

ip netns add red		#Create new network namespace red
ip netns add green		#Create new network namespace green

ip netns exec red ip link # {ip netns exec red} runs the command {ip link} in ns red
ip netns exec green ip link # {ip netns exec green} runs the command {ip link} in ns green

ovs-vsctl add-br OVS1 	#We need a openVSwitch in root namespace to talk to red and green with name OVS1
ovs-vsctl show 			#Shows the details of the OpenVSwitch and newly added port


#Use veth pipe to connect network ns red and vSwitch and green and vSwitch
ip link add eth0-r type veth peer name veth-r	#Create pipe with eth0-r and veth-r at both end
ip link set eth0-r netns red 				#Put eth0-r in ns red
ip link 									#We see that root ns doesnt have eth0-r
ip netns exec red ip link 					#We see that red ns contain eth0-r	

ovs-vsctl show 					#See the switch characteristics
ovs-vsctl add-port OVS1 veth-r 	#Adds veth-r to vSwitch OVS1
ovs-vsctl show 					#See the added port to vSwitch
#red and vSwitch connected 

ip link add eth-g type veth peer name veth-g 	#Create pipe with eth0-g and veth-g at both end
ip link set eth0-g netns green				#Put eth0-g in ns red
ovs-vsctl add-port OVS1 veth-g				#Adds veth-g to vSwitch OVS1

ip link  						#We see that root ns doesnt have eth0-g
ip netns exec green ip link  	#We see that green ns contain eth0-g
ovs-vsctl show 					#See the added port to vSwitch
#green and vSwitch connected

Bringing the interfaces UP and Assigning IP Addresses 
#root namespace
ip link 				#See that veth-r and veth-g STATE is DOWN
						#veth-r@ <BROADCAST, MULTICAST> is seen 
ip link set veth-r up 	#Set the veth-r interface up
ip link 				#See that eth0-r and eth-g STATE is LOWERLAYERDOWN
						#veth-r@ <NO-CARRIER, BROADCAST, MULTICAST, UP> is seen. 

#red namespace
ip netns exec red ip link set lo up 				#Bring up the loopback interface in netns red
ip netns exec red ip link set eth0-r up 			#Bring up the eth-r interface in netns red 

ip netns exec red ip address add 10.0.0.1/24 dev eth0-r #Assign the IP address to eth0-r
ip netns exec red ip route 	#See that now we have a device for ip address 10.0.0.0/24 via eth0-r
							#10.0.0.0/24 dev eth0-r proto kernel scope link src 10.0.0.1
							#Shows that there exist a path
							
ip route 	# See that root netns has no clue of 10.0.0.0/24

#green namespace
ip link set veth-g up 	#		Set the veth-g interface up
#Shortcut
ip netns exec green bash 		#Removes the need of typing ip netns exec green everytime
ip link set lo up 				#set the loopback device up
ip link set eth0-g up 			#Set the eth-g device up
ip address add 10.0.0.2/24 dev eth0-g  #Add network address 10.0.0.2/24 on device eth0-g
exit 							#Comes out of netns green

ip netns exec red ping 10.0.0.2 #See ping from green replying

III) How to run local DHCP to give ip address to a device in a network namespace using vlan tag for process isolation.

#Run commands in II) to get a (Red)--(Router)--(Green) setup
								(h1)--(s1)--(h2)
ovs-vsctl set port veth-r tag=100 	#Namespace red has green are 
ovs-vsctl set port veth-g tag=200	#separated at the switch by vlan
ovs-vsctl show 			#See that interface have tag: added to it

ip netns exec red ping 10.0.0.2  #Packets wont cross the switch because of vlan tag

#remove ip address of eth0-r and eth0-g since we will be using dhcp instead 
ip netns exec red ip address delete 10.0.0.1/24 dev eth0-r
ip netns exec green ip address delete 10.0.0.2/24 dev eth0-g

ip netns add dhcp-r			#to run DCHP server on netns for red tenents
ip netns add dhcp-g			#to run DCHP server on netns for red tenents

#connection of ns dhcp-r and dhcp-g to the switch will be done using internal port tap-r and tap-g and not veth pair
ovs-vsctl add-port OVS1 tap-r 			#You may seem error stating "Could not open network device"
ovs-vsctl show 							#The error is because it doesn't identify the use of the port
ovs-vsctl set interface tap-r type=internal #The error will be removed after it knows its internal port
ovs-vsctl show 							#No error in tap-r section
ovs-vsctl set port tap-r tag=100		#Set the vlan tag for tap-r to be 100

ovs-vsctl add-port OVS1 tap-g
ovs-vsctl set interface tap-g type=internal
ovs-vsctl set port tap-g tag=200
ovs-vsctl show

#Move the tap-r and tap-g to their netns dhcp-r and dhcp-g
ip link set tap-r netns dhcp-r		#Moves tap-r to netns dhcp-r
ip link set tap-g netns dhcp-g
ip netns exec dhcp-r ip link 		# Shows that tap-r is here

#move into netns dhcp-r to up the devices
ip 
ip netns exec dhcp-r bash 		#start bash in netns dhcp-r
ip link set lo up				#Up the loopbach device
ip link set tap-r up			#Up the tap-r device
ip address add 10.50.50.2/24 dev tap-r #Add IP address to the dhcp-r port 
exit

#move into netns dhcp-g to up the devices
ip netns exec dhcp-g bash
ip link set lo up
ip link set tap-g up
ip address add 10.50.50.2/24 dev tap-g #Add IP address to the dhcp-g port 

#Run a DNS server on dhcp-r netns to give address to any tenants
ip netns exec dhcp-r dnsmasq --interface=tap-r \			#Run dnsmasq in the dhcp-r netns on tap-r 
--dhcp-range=10.50.50.10,10.50.50.100,255.255.255.0  		#interface in the range of 50.10 to 50.100

ip netns exec dhcp-g dnsmasq --interface=tap-g \			#Run dnsmasq in the dhcp-g netns on tap-g 
--dhcp-range=10.50.50.10,10.50.50.100,255.255.255.0  		#interface in the range of 50.10 to 50.100

#To check which process is running on which network nameserver
ps -ef | grep dnsmasq 			#Obtain the PID for the dnsmasq with UID nobody
ip netns identify <pid of dnsmasq> #We see dnsmasq in tap-r is in dhcp-r
ip netns exec dhcp-r ip address 	 

ip netns exec red ip address 		#Shows there is still no address for eth0-r

ip netns exec red dhclient eth0-r	#Assigns ip address to the adapter eth0-r
ip netns exec red ip a 				#Find the IP address here

ip netns exec green dhclient eth0-g #Assigns ip address to the adapter eth0-g
ip netns exec green ip a 			#Find the IP address here

IV) How to start 2 dockers and connect them using ovs-docker or ovs-vsct

#Install openVSwitch
sudo apt install openvswitch-switch

#check whether ovs-docker is available in your /usr/bin if not then
cd /usr/bin
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openvswitch/ovs/master/utilities/ovs-docker
chmod a+rwx ovs-docker

#Creating an OVS Bridge
sudo ovs-vsctl add-br ovs-br1
sudo show ovs-vsctl show

# Giving your bridge ip address
sudo ifconfig ovs-br1 173.16.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up

#Starting ubuntu docker containers to act as hosts
#To have control over the network interfaces add --privileged 
#We opted for ubuntu:14.04 even when 18.04 and 20.04 are available because 14.04 have ifconfig and ip package installed.
sudo docker run -it --privileged --name container1 ubuntu:14.04 bash
sudo docker run -it --privileged --name container2 ubuntu:14.04 bash

#Checking the network interfaces in host containers to see that there will be just lo and eth0
# here eth0 or the interface with ifindex=2 is very important as if you take it down then there wont be any further communication between your docker and outside world and you have to stop the docker and start again. 
# Even with eth0 active you will be able to ping to the other host. Once we have set up our bridge we can take it down

#In container1
ip link
#In container2
ip link

#Connect OVS Bridge with the 2 host containers
sudo ovs-docker add-port ovs-br1 eth1 container1 --ipaddress=173.16.1.2/24
sudo ovs-docker add-port ovs-br1 eth1 container2 --ipaddress=173.16.1.3/24

#Go to container 1 and see ip address to see eth1 there an
# Now take down the eth0 to ensure there is no alternate path for our packet to reach other host container.
#In container 1
ip link set eth0 down
#In container 2
ip link set eth0 down

#ping the other device to see it taking eth1 as the gateway
#In container 1
ping 173.16.1.3
route
#In container 2
ping 173.16.1.2
route
