TRex QA
1. Can we work with just single interface TRex with centos and change configuration file accordingly
	Use veth pair as one of the interface(s) and start TRex.
	If you manage to start the TRex server succesfully "./t-rex-64 -i" and manage to connect to the server using the console "./trex-console" then we can run "portattr" to see in which mode trex is in.
	Use "l2 -p0 --dst 00:00:00:00:00:00" to set the destination address of port 0/1 and verify the change in "portattr"
	Start the file transfer in Trex using "trex> start -p 0 -f stl/udp_1pkt.py -d 10" to use just one of the port and sent the packets to its corresponding receiver
	
2. In linux network namespace using veth pair "ip route" do not identify 2 interfaces to the same network namespace to TRex? What should we do to create individual entry to the namespace?
	Do not connect 2 namespace to each other directly by shifting both the end points of the veth to the DUT namespace which would make the network to chose only one interface to be active (as entered in ip route) which also means any packets which is sent to that namespace will only chose one among the 2 pair and because of that the TRex arp resolution may not work or even if it work the MAC address of the receiver will be same as the interface. So connect the veth pair to switch and let the switch take care of finding individual exit. Otherwise the packets sent by Port 0 and Port 1 will be received by just one interface.
	
3. Even using bridge in between 2 netns the packets sent from TRex is received only at one interface at the DUT in L3 mode.Why?
	In L3 mode the MAC address is found by ARP which causes the problem. Even without TRex, if you do arp you will find the mac address received from 2 interfaces from the DUT will be same even though they are assigned 2 different mac address and link level. Receiving the wrong MAC address can only be set straight by manually assigning the right MAC address using "l2 -p 1 --dst aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff".
	Discussion on this is at 
	https://serverfault.com/questions/247472/arp-replies-contain-wrong-mac-address
	
4. How to connect TRex with Mininet
	While mininet creates it topology it create the ovs bridge in the root namespace and hosts in different network namespace. So create 2 veth pair in roo tnamespace and add it to the switch. Run TRex using the other end of newly created veth pair interfaces with the destination ip/ mac address of the hosts in mininet. You can see the connectivity from the rootnamespace by pinging to hosts after you connect the 2 veth interfaces by "ping 10.0.0.1". 
	
5. How to run multiple instances of TRex
	You have to change the configuration file for both the trex instances as
	vim /etc/trex_cfg1.yaml
	paste 
	- port_limit: 2
	  version: 2
	  interfaces: ['veth0', 'veth1']  <--- different ports
	  prefix: instance1                   <--- unique prefix
	  zmq_pub_port: 4600                  <--- unique ZMQ publisher port
	  zmq_rpc_port: 4601                  <--- unique ZMQ RPC port
	  
	 vim /etc/trex_cfg2.yaml
	 - port_limit: 2
	  version: 2
	  interfaces: ['veth2', 'veth3']  <--- different ports
	  prefix: instance2                   <--- unique prefix
	  zmq_pub_port: 4610                  <--- unique ZMQ publisher port
	  zmq_rpc_port: 4611                  <--- unique ZMQ RPC port
	  
	Run TRex server using the following commands
	 trex1/v2.89/t-rex-64 --cfg /etc/trex_cfg1.yaml
	 trex2/v2.89/t-rex-64 --cfg /etc/trex_cfg2.yaml
	
	And connect to the TRex server using the following commands
	 TRex Instance1
	 trex1/v2.89/trex-console -p 4601
	 TRex Instance2
	 trex2/v2.89/trex-console -p 4611
	 
	refer 1.2.4 of FAQ
	https://trex-tgn.cisco.com/trex/doc/trex_faq.html
	
6. What are some frequently used commands in TRex?
	portattr                                                    -> gives basic infom
	service 													-> enables service mode to setup source and dstination
	l3 -p 0 --src 10.0.0.10 --dst 10.0.0.2 						-> Under service mode we can set L3 address
	l2 -p1 --dst 00:00:00:00:00:00								-> Under service mode we can assign L2 dst address.
	arp 														-> Looks for mac address on the dst address given in l3
	service --off												-> Turn of the service mode to run the below code
	start -f stl/udp_1pkt.py -d 5								-> Runs packets according to file specifies
	
7. Is it necessary to have 2 ports veth0 and veth1? or veth2 and veth3 in the configuration file? 
	No we can replace one of the interface with dummy and still the statless udp packet transmission will work
	
8. What is the maximum Tx you get over a http communication over trex docker?
	After deleting the low_end mode line in the configuration and checking the number of process available for the docker by 'grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l' to be 4. I ran the stateful command ' ./t-rex-64 -f cap2/http_simple.yaml -m 50000000 -d 100 -l 1000 -c 4'. The Total Tx Bw in port 1 became 4 Gbps.
		So the answer is 4Gbps is the saturation for my dell 5755 in virtual box with 8 GB ram and 4 processor. 
		
9. Why do you need ipg(Inter Packet Gap) and rtt(Round Trip Time) in the YAML configuration file while running stateful mode of trex. Case in point cap2/dns.yaml. And why should ipg and rtt be same value?
	In stateless mode the server do not wait for the packet to be received from the client. Even before that using the rtt value or ipg value the server sents back the answer. So we have to keep this value same?
	
10. How to fix pcap files that you record in Stateful mode? Shouldn't there be some corrections done for this to work?
	Yes, you can see < https://trex-tgn.cisco.com/trex/doc/trex_appendix_fixing_pcaps.html#_large_packets >
	Note that the packets in the pcap file should contain the request and the acknowledgment. An example < https://trex-tgn.cisco.com/trex/doc/trex_manual.html#_dns_basic_example >. The pcap file in cap2/dns.yaml contains just 2 packets. See for yourself in wireshark. 
	
==========================TRex and Mininet====================================
8. In normal condition when a host do not have trex running we usually receive packet on the h1-eth0 or hi-eth0 for some i. So tcpdump -nli h1-eth0 would give us the arriving packets. But on a host where TRex is installed it do not show packets received at this port. What changed? How to find which port is receiving it?
	If a host has multiple interface connected to the switch (here 's1'), it will only chose one to receive and transmit. In our case where Trex is installed in a host there will be one or two veth port connected to the switch 's1' for TRex purpose and h1-eth0 that came with Mininet topology.  So using "trex> portattr" command figure out what is the mac address the destination ip provides using arp. Which will be resolved automatically. Check in your host "$: ip link" to see which device matches the mac address. Now run tcpdump -nli on that. An example answer is 
	"tcpdump -nli veth2"
9. Can I turn on the TRex server and console simultaneously in a script?
	It wont work as it takes for the TRex server to become active so a delay of 2 to 5 seconds is recommended
	
10. While connecting veth pair to TRex will the connectivity go from the switch 's1' to which all the hosts are connected?
	Yes, if any one of the link is not set to be "up" then the whole OpenVSwitch controlled by ovs-vsctl is broken and all the pings will fail. So irrespective of the namespace ensure you split the algorithm to set the newly created link up after connecting to the switch 's1' in our case.
	
11. Is there a way to save the mininet topology when the os switches off?
	No, its better to automate setting up the mininet environment. Use the following github repo to have a 3 host 1 switch topology.

12. Does mininet python API helps to run commands on xterm within a bash file which is run on  files such as subprocess.call("setupH1MininetPart2.sh",shell=True)
	No, it suppress those commands for some reasons I don't understand. An example of such instance is line 35,36,37 and 38 on setupH1MininetPart2.sh contains xterm command which are ignored but the same command when run in runMininet.py on line 34,37 and 39. It runs fine.
	
	Similarly the sleep function is also not ran in bash scrip using subprocess.call("file.sh", shell=True)

13. Sometimes pingall doesn't work and some host become unreachable? why?
	This is seen in MininetTrexAstfEastWest and I don't know, this problems seems to go away when I stop the whole network and restart it. So always pingall again if you find the network is broken. 
===========================Mininet: ASTF Client Server ===================================
1. Why is my server not transmitting back to the client? I cross checked the traffic with 't' in server terminal.
	There are a lot of reasons why this may happen. Let me present the setup that will work. 
		1. Set up 2 ports with ip address 0.12 and .13 using /etc/trex_cfg2.yaml
		2. Start trex-console in the same netns i.e if trex is in host1 then console should be in host1 too.
		2. using 'service', do the following 
			l3 -p0 --src 10.0.0.12 --dst 10.0.0.13
			l3 -p1 --src 10.0.0.13 --dst 10.0.0.12
			This is loopback configuration
			NOTE: EXIT FROM SERVICE (service --off) OTHERWISE SERVER WONT TALK TO CLIENT
		3. start -f astf/http_simple.py 
		4. Look at the server screen press 't' to see the movement.
		
	Another case when it will work is the following but it will converge to loopback and not from host1 to host2
		
		TRex server is in host1(10.0.0.1) in astf mode ["/opt/trex2/v2.89/t-rex-64 -cfg /etc/trex_cfg2.yaml --astf"] and TRex client is run from host2(10.0.0.2) ["/opt/trex2/v2.89/trex-console -i -s 10.0.0.12 -p 4611"]. If the ip address of veth2 and veth3 is 10.0.0.12 and 10.0.0.13
		1. TRex should have the following command
			l3 -p 0 --src 10.0.0.12 --dst 10.0.0.2
			l3 -p 1 --src 10.0.0.13 --dst 10.0.0.2
		2. trex-console shouln't be in service mode i.e. service --off
		3. "route" in h1 should show the following
			Destination 	Gateway		Genmask 		Flags Metric 	Ref	Use		Iface
			10.0.0.0 		0.0.0.0		255.255.255.0 	U 		0 		0 	 0		veth2
			10.0.0.0 		0.0.0.0		255.255.255.0 	U 		0 		0 	 0		veth3
			10.0.0.0 		0.0.0.0		255.0.0.0 		U 		0 		0 	 0		h1-eth0
			
		   "route" in h2 should show the following
			10.0.0.0 		0.0.0.0		255.0.0.0 		U 		0 		0 	 0		h2-eth0
		4 "arp" in h1 should be the following
		    Address 		HWtype 	Haddress 	Glags Mask 	Ifac
			10.0.0.2 		ether 	xx:xx:xx	C			veth2
			
		   "arp" in h2 should show the following
			10.0.0.10 		ether 	xx:xx:xx	C			h2-eth0
			10.0.0.13		ether 	xx:xx:xx	C			h2-eth0
			10.0.0.1 		ether 	xx:xx:xx	C			h2-eth0
			10.0.0.12 		ether 	xx:xx:xx	C			h2-eth0
			10.0.0.11 		      	(incomplete)			h2-eth0
			10.0.0.3 		ether 	xx:xx:xx	C			h2-eth0
		5. After sometime the trex-console will go offline after running the following command
			trex> start -f astf/http_simple_1serverclient.py 
			
			Dont try to reconnect/ force reconnect to it. Just let it be.
			
		6. There are not tcpdump running on any host. 
		7. Just run "wireshark &" on veth2 of host1. Because the trex packets are received not at h1-eth0 but at veth2. 
		8. Press 't' in the server window and pray and wait for the server side to start talking. Probably after 5000 opackets from port 0 should trigger the port 1 communication.
			
2. Is there any thread on using 2 TRex in --astf --astf-server-only (server side) and --astf --ast-client-mask 1 (client side) alone.

3. Will ASTF with client and server on different machine work?
	Yes it will work. These are the conditions required for the same. 
	1. Your TRex should work with just 1 interface. The other should be dummy as follows:
		interfaces: ["dummy", "veth0"]
		and
		interfaces: ["veth3", "dummy"]
	2. Make sure when you test out the code you don't add --astf-server-only or --astf-client-mask 0x1 on the wrong server. 
	
4. If you see server returning RST on your wireshark. What should we do to solve it?
	If your wireshark shows your source, dest is fine and your 'trex> portattr' shows the ip address is resolved and in L3 mode. Then that means you should have swapped your interfaces from ["dummy", "veth0"] to ["veth0", "dummy"] on your server and client. And change the order of 
	(ip1,default_gateway1)
	(ip2,default_gateway2)
	
	to 
	
	(ip2,default_gateway2)
	(ip1,default_gateway1)
